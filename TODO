Overall:
GUI:
 10) get log panel/tail log panels to scroll automatically
     o yview('moveto') does not work
 17) Help Panel
     o use a two-paned window for an indexed help
     o write help documentation
 20) Treeview/TabularPanel
     o Horizontal scrollbars on tree view do not work
     o Column widths are off a little (wider than desired)
 21) Have to work on resize of widgets etc with row/column configure
 22) use Tk validatecommand on widgets
 24) guisave/guiload only works on first sublevel i.e. children of the master panel
     should we extend to every panel or leave as is
 27) Splash panel
     o get rid of border around progressbar and progressbar.pbar
     o many statements are not even seen, remove them
 29) icons or status bar to show what state services are in??
 30) What is the best way to handle child panels and db connections?
     o psycopg2 claims excellent threaded cursors - do we use the main connection
       in WraithPanel and pass created cursors to children? -> have to trust the
       children to rollback on any errors
     o or do we create a new connection for each child that needs it?
 31) use postgresql listen/notify for updating data from tables
 34) look into Treeview virtual events Select,Open,Close to see if it is anything
     we can use
 35) implement query functionality, need a simplistic query language in xml or
     something
 36) add wildcards to some fields in query i.e. mac address allow search on vendor
     with 00:01:02.*
Iyri:
 26) how to identify gps device failure, removal?
 53) implement spoof, txpwr commands
 54) Iyri fails to stop (now) on ctrl-c when it starts in pause state
 55) start gpsd if it does not start automatically (assuming gps device is
     plugged in)
Radio:
 1) Should we add support for AVS, Prism headers ?
 2) radiotap: ensure data pad is handled for atheros cards (any others?)
 3) in mpdu, fully parse
    o control wrapper
    o +htc
    o info-elements
     - RSN Std 8.4.2.27, #48
     - TIM Info-Element #5 from beacons could be useful
     - parse timing advance
 5) how to support a-msdu etc
 6) 802.1X parsing as well as additional mpdu i.e. 802.11u, 802.11s etc
 7) compile/use own oui file, not relying on aircrack-ng
